## Installation

Please visit [the installation guide](https://www.getaccio.ai/docs/get-started/installation).

## How Accio works?

ðŸ’» **Modeling**

Accio introduces a powerful Model Definition Language (MDL) enabling you to shape your data effortlessly. Transform your tables into `Models` and establish connections
using `Relations`. Unlock the true potential of Business Intelligence (BI) by formulating impactful `Metrics` with Accio's intuitive MDL.

ðŸš€ **Access**

Accio offers a join-free SQL solution that allows users to query models as if accessing one expensive view. Focuses on enabling users to effortlessly perform BI-style queries.
Traditional SQL users can easily write readable and semantically rich SQL queries that are also easy to maintain.

ðŸ”¥ **Deliver**

Accio implements the PostgreSQL Wire Protocol for easy integration, enabling users to effortlessly deliver data to existing systems and various tools, such as BI tools and Database
IDEs.

## Special Thanks

- [Trino](https://github.com/trinodb/trino)

  Accio's SQL analysis layer is fundamentally based on a modified version of Trino's SQL analysis engine. Trino's clean, readable, and maintainable SQL analysis layer served as a
  significant inspiration, allowing us to focus more on researching and exploring Accio's syntax and models.
- [CrateDB](https://github.com/crate/crate)

  Accio's PostgreSQL Wire Protocol is inspired by CrateDB. CrateDB's implementation of the PostgreSQL Wire Protocol is very clear and easy to maintain, which significantly helped
  us clarify the focus and architecture during the early development stages. This allowed us to concentrate on researching and exploring Accio's syntax and models.
